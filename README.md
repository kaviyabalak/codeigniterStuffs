# codeigniterStuffs
This contains a mvc code using codeigniter framework.
I took a student database as an example which has 5 columns(id,name,age,address,language,photo)
You can insert those fields in frontend and also can view those records using codeigniter framework
If someone wants to upload a image and insert data into datatbase using codeigniter framework this code might be helpful
also it is necessary not to declare the datatype of photo column as BLOB since it might consume more space so it is advisble to 
declare as varchar(30)
